# Roga Programming Analyst Assignment

Thank you for showing interest in one of our Programming Analyst positions! As part of our interview process, we would like to ask you to complete the following assignment.

The solution in this repository mimics a simple library that contains a collection of books and has methods for adding, borrowing, returning, and returning books to and from the library.

How would you improve this project to make it ready for an enterprise/production setting including debugging any errors you might find?

## Instructions
1. Fork the project to your GitHub.
2. Clone the forked project to your computer.
3. Create a new branch with for your changes.
4. Open a pull request with your changes including any explanations as you see fit.
5. Email the link to your PR to your contact at Roga Partners for review.

Best of luck!



In this file I have completed the programming assignment and made several improvements to make the code more production-ready Here are the key enhancements I implemented

1. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Added try-catch blocks to all functions to capture and log errors accurately.
   - Implemented detailed logging throughout the application to provide precise information about the program's execution and any issues that may arise.
2. Input Validation:
   - Added validation checks for input parameters to prevent potential runtime errors.
   - Included clear error messages for invalid inputs to guide users.
3. Configuration Management:
   - Moved environment-specific variables (like log file paths) to an appsettings.json file for easier configuration across different environments.
   - (Because right now it's a small project, so it doesn't matter that much, but if I had a big project with lots of data like this, it's the best way if I have a 
       test environment, etc.)
 4. Code Organization:
   - Implemented interfaces to improve code structure and maintainability.
   - Ensured the code is clean and well-organized for easier debugging and future modifications.
   - 
These improvements will help in quickly identifying and resolving issues in a production environment, make the code more robust, and facilitate easier maintenance and updates in the future.

I look forward to discussing these changes and any other aspects of the assignment with you.

Best regards,
